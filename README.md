## Problem Statement
Providing a digital infrastructure and application to address the needs of the differently-abled, facilitating their admission in various courses, providing guidance and counseling to differently-abled individuals, creating awareness about their needs, and other general issues concerning their learning.

## Inspiration
Nearly 3/4th of 5-years old specially-abled are left out of the education system. There is a need for an environment that caters to the category of ailments that exist in the students and makes provisions that need to be made in order to make them feel special, cared for and set the right mindset while they grow. And so Educazy was born.

## What it does
Educazy is an educational platform for students with special needs. It connects them with the world outside by breaking barriers and opening opportunities for them. Equipped with powerful features like voice navigation, online meets with sign language detection and subtitles, text to braille/audio conversion, one-portal-one-progress-card with normalized scores, it gives them everything they need to study independently, just like every other child.

## Challenges we ran into
Building an entire educational platform that supports everything a differently-abled student would need is not easy. Often the code would break, the models wouldn't work, the ui would mess up. But we worked day and night to fix and rebuild things.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Sign Language Support
- Braille Conversion
- Voice Controlled App
- One portal One Report Card

## What we learned
Teamwork. Creativity. Perseverance. We learned how to come up with ideas, work on them, and resolve issues together.

## What's next for Educazy
Connecting it to government platforms, getting schools to join the project, and making it reach each and every student that needs a platform where they can learn without facing any barriers.
